title: Changing the Subject
---

From questions that a few of you have been asking over the past few days,
it seems that we are not all entirely comfortable with changing the subject of formulae. I have quickly put together the below as a bit of a crash course.

Let me know if it is helpful, or if you want to work through with me in more detail.

### Changing the subject
Sometimes a formula can be rearranged to a more useful format. For example, the formula

\[ F = 1.8C + 32\]

Which converts from degrees Centigrade to degrees Fahrenheit. It can be rearranged to the form

$C = \ldots$

to enable the temperature in degrees Fahrenheit to be converted to degrees Fahrenheit. We say that the formula has been rearranged to make $C$ the subject of the formula.

##### Worked Example One
Rearrange the formula

$$F = 1.8C + 32$$

to make $C$ the subject of the formula. The aim is to remove all terms from the right hand side of the equation except from the $C$. We do this by doing inverse operations.

##### Solution
First, subtract $32$ from both sides of the equation. *It is always easier to do addition and subtraction first.*

$$F - 32 = 1.8C$$

Then dividing by 1.8 gives

$$\frac{F-32}{1.8}=C$$

So the formula can be rearranged as

$$C=\frac{F-32}{1.8}$$

##### Worked Example Two
Make $v$ the subject of the formula

$$s = \frac{(u+v)t}{2}$$

##### Solution
Now, fractions make our lives difficult, so it is normally easiest to get rid of any fractions first. To do this, multiply both sides of the equation by two

$$2s = (u+v)t$$

Our $u$ is now stuck inside the brackets, so to unwrap it we need to expand brackets, giving

$$2s = ut + vt$$

This is now exactly the same (with slightly different numbers...) as Example One. We subtract $ut$ from both sides of the formula

$$2s - ut = vt$$

Then dividing by $v$ gives

$$v = \frac{2s - ut}{t}$$

##### Exercises
Make $x$ the subject in each of the following formulae.
<div class="container">
<div class="row">
<div class="col-sm-4">
(a) $y=4x$
</div>
<div class="col-sm-4">
(b) $y=2x + 3$
</div>
<div class="col-sm-4">
(c) $y=4x-8$
</div>
</div>
<br>
<div class="row">
<div class="col-sm-4">
(d) $y=\frac{x+2}{4}$
</div>
<div class="col-sm-4">
(e) $y =\frac{x-2}{5}$
</div>
<div class="col-sm-4">
(f) y=$x+a$
</div>
</div>
<br>
<div class="row">
<div class="col-sm-4">
(g) y=$\frac{x-b}{a}$
</div>
<div class="col-sm-4">
(h) $y=ax+c$
</div>
<div class="col-sm-4">
(i) $y=\frac{ax+b}{c}$
</div>
</div>
</div>
