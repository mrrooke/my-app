<p>From questions that a few of you have been asking over the past few days,
it seems that we are not all entirely comfortable with changing the subject of formulae. I have quickly put together the below as a bit of a crash course.</p>

<p>Let me know if it is helpful, or if you want to work through with me in more detail.</p>

<h3 id="changing-the-subject">Changing the subject</h3>
<p>Sometimes a formula can be rearranged to a more useful format. For example, the formula</p>

<p>[ F = 1.8C + 32]</p>

<p>Which converts from degrees Centigrade to degrees Fahrenheit. It can be rearranged to the form</p>

<p>$C = \ldots$</p>

<p>to enable the temperature in degrees Fahrenheit to be converted to degrees Fahrenheit. We say that the formula has been rearranged to make $C$ the subject of the formula.</p>

<h5 id="worked-example-one">Worked Example One</h5>
<p>Rearrange the formula</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">F = 1.8C + 32</script>

<p>to make $C$ the subject of the formula. The aim is to remove all terms from the right hand side of the equation except from the $C$. We do this by doing inverse operations.</p>

<h5 id="solution">Solution</h5>
<p>First, subtract $32$ from both sides of the equation. <em>It is always easier to do addition and subtraction first.</em></p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">F - 32 = 1.8C</script>

<p>Then dividing by 1.8 gives</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\frac{F-32}{1.8}=C</script>

<p>So the formula can be rearranged as</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">C=\frac{F-32}{1.8}</script>

<h5 id="worked-example-two">Worked Example Two</h5>
<p>Make $v$ the subject of the formula</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">s = \frac{(u+v)t}{2}</script>

<h5 id="solution-1">Solution</h5>
<p>Now, fractions make our lives difficult, so it is normally easiest to get rid of any fractions first. To do this, multiply both sides of the equation by two</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">2s = (u+v)t</script>

<p>Our $u$ is now stuck inside the brackets, so to unwrap it we need to expand brackets, giving</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">2s = ut + vt</script>

<p>This is now exactly the same (with slightly different numbersâ€¦) as Example One. We subtract $ut$ from both sides of the formula</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">2s - ut = vt</script>

<p>Then dividing by $v$ gives</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">v = \frac{2s - ut}{t}</script>

<p>Make $x$ the subject in each of the following formulae.</p>
